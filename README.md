## How To Play
Your objective is to complete rows by placing tetrominoes (blocks) as they fall down from the top of the board.
* Single-Player:
	- Try to earn as many points as you can while trying to avoid reaching the top of the board.
* Two-Player:
	- The first player to reach the top of the board, loses. If both players reach the top at the same time, the score will then be factored to decide who's the winner.

To pause the game you can press "ESC" at any point. You'll be returned to the main-menu where you'll be able to toggle between different options, resume your game or start a new one.

<b>Player 1 controls:</b>
 * 'a' - moves the block to the left
 * 'd' - moves the block to the right
 * 's' - rotates the block clock-wise
 * 'w' - rotates the block counter-clock-wise

<b>Player 2 controls:</b>
 * 'j' - moves the block to the left
 * 'l' - moves the block to the right
 * 'k' - rotates the block clock-wise
 * 'i' - rotates the block counter-clock-wise

<b>The scoring system:</b>
* Each placed block earns the player 5 points.
* Each completed row earns the player points based on the number of rows completed:
	- 1 completed row earns you 100 points.
	- 2 completed rows earn you 250 points.
	- 3 completed rows earn you 500 points.
	- 4 completed rows earn you 1000 points.
